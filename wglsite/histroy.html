<h2> Histroy:- </h2>
<p>
Warangal was the capital of a Hindu Shaivite kingdom ruled by the Kakatiya dynasty from the 12th to the 14th 
centuries. 
The old name of this newly formed city is Orugallu. 'Oru' means one and 'Kallu' means stone. The entire city was carved in 
a single rock, hence the name Orukallu meaning 'one rock'. The city was also called Ekasila nagaram. The Kakatiyas left many 
monuments, including an impressive fortress, four massive stone gateways, the Swayambhu temple dedicated to Shiva, and the 
Ramappa temple situated near Ramappa Lake. The cultural and administrative distinction of the Kakatiyas was mentioned by the 
famous traveller Marco Polo. Famous or well-known rulers included Ganapathi Deva, Prathapa Rudra, and Rani (queen) Rudramma
 Devi. After the defeat of Prataparadura, the Musunuri Nayaks united seventy two Nayak chieftains and captured Warangal from
 Delhi sultanate and ruled for fifty years. Jealousy and mutual rivalry between Nayaks ultimately led to the downfall of Hindus in 
1370 A.D and success of Bahmanis. Bahmani Sultanate later broke up into several smaller sultanates, of which the Golconda 
sultanate ruled Warangal. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb conquered Golconda in 1687, and it remained part of the Mughal empire 
until the southern provinces of the empire split away to become the state of Hyderabad in 1724 which included the Telangana region 
and some parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Hyderabad was annexed to India in 1948, and became an Indian state. 
In 1956 Hyderabad was partitioned as part of the States Reorganization Act, and Telangana, the Telugu-speaking region of 
Hyderabad state which includes Warangal, was joined to Andhra Pradesh.</p>
