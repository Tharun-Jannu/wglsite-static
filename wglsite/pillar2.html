<h2> About </h2>
<P>  The Thousand Pillar Temple is one of the very old temples of South India that was built by the kakatiyas. It stands out to be
 a masterpiece and achieved major heights in terms of architectural skills by the ancient kakathiya vishwakarma sthapathis.
 It is believed that the Thousand Pillar Temple was built by King Rudra Deva in 1163 AD. The Thousand Pillar Temple is a specimen
 of the Kakatiyan style of architecture of the 12th century. <br>
<br>
It was destroyed by the Tughlaq dynasty during their invasion of South India. It consists one temple and other building. 
There are one thousand pillars in the building and the temple, but no pillar obstructs a person in any point of the temple to 
see the god in the other temple.<br>
<br>
The present day engineers have taken out all the pillars from the building. After they lifted all the pillars they encountered a 
huge mass of sand. It took nearly two weeks for them to take away all the sand. It was wet sand, because of a pipe connection
 from the nearby water body named Bhadrakali Cheruvu.<br>
Rudra Deva built this temple in 1163 AD in the style of star shaped Chalukyan temples and named after him as
 Sri Rudreshwara Swamy Temple, it is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Separate shires for Lord Surya & Lord Vishnu in the temple 
are connected to main shrine by a square mandap in the centre. A beautifully carved giant Nandi (bull) is seen on the platform
 connecting the shrines. The exterior wall of the temple, the ceiling slabs and the four central pillars of the mandap are decorated with finely carved sculptures. Poojas are still performed.
<br>
The actual thousand pillar hall situated behind Nandi in the temple complex is currently being renovated by the archelogical 
department and closed for visitors.
<br>
The temple is located between Warangal and Hanmakonda Chowrasta, close to main road.

<h2> Temple Architecture:- </h2>
<p>
The Thousand Pillar Temple with its ruins lies near the Hanamkonda-Warangal Highway in Telangana State, about 150 kilometers
 from Hyderabad city. This temple is star-shaped with several shrines and lingams. There are three shrines inside the temple called 
the Trikutalayam. The three shrines of the Thousand Pillar Temple are dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Surya. 
The Thousand Pillar Temple is surrounded by a big garden in which many small lingam shrines can be seen. There are 1,000 richly 
carved pillars and a Nandi bull in the temple. The Nandi bull was carved out of a black basalt monolith that has been highly polished.
<br> <br>
At a distance of 6 Kms from Warangal Railway Station (in Hanmakonda part of the city), Thousand Pillar Temple is one of the 
finest examples of Kakatiya architecture.
